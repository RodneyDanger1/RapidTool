// tests/oracle.spec.ts — acceptance tests from the A7 oracle (project.oracle)
// machine-generated from RapidTool packet f13debeb-b530-445b-9f52-85b82ad7839e; regenerate, don't hand-edit.
// REAL assertions, no todo stubs (fixes/135). Row ids are PINNED: the verify
// harness seeds + pins orc-* ids across runs (E-08) — never rename or drop
// one. Each test asserts what the emitted modules ACTUALLY do today:
//   * where the generated P6 module defines functions (the deterministic
//     template's synthesize/JOBS/REJECTION), those are asserted directly;
//   * store/api modules are asserted over their real exports;
//   * an oracle row whose target seam is a TODO(E-15) stub asserts the seam
//     rejects — that test FAILS the moment the seam is implemented, which is
//     the signal to replace it with the row's real acceptance assertion;
//   * an oracle row with NO emitted module surface to assert against (106
//     T-08 / F-05) is a visibly-marked test.skip("<id> — NOT IMPLEMENTED") —
//     never an always-true assertion; node:test reports it as skipped (never
//     a pass) and the README counts it separately from the assertable rows;
//   * nothing here pretends a stub satisfies its brief.
// Run: node --experimental-strip-types --test tests/oracle.spec.ts
// TREE mode (fixes/144 M2): this project carries a generatedTree, so the
// scaffold assembled those files (verbatim, at their own paths) instead of
// the single P6 module; section 1 imports the tree ENTRY module below.

// path the legacy P6 host would have used) so the emitted npm test executes
// the REAL generated tree — its cross-file imports must resolve or this spec
// fails to load. Export names are generated content, so the entry is asserted
// as a namespace that must carry at least one real export.
